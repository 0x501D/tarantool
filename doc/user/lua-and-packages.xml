<para>
  During start up, the server can allow connections on up to two TCP ports:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
      Primary port. This port is for handling requests in the
      <link xlink:href="https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/blob/master/doc/box-protocol.txt" xlink:title="A complete BNF of Tarantool client/server protocol">native Tarantool protocol</link>
      (also called the "binary protocol"), and provides full data access.
      </para>
      <para>
      The default value of the port is <literal>3303</literal>,
      as defined in the <olink targetptr="primary_port"/>
      configuration option.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
      Administrative port, which is for handling requests in unconverted text (also called the "text protocol"),
      which defaults to <literal>3313</literal>,
      and is defined in the <olink targetptr="admin_port"/>
      configuration option.
    </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  Traditionally, in the absence of authentication,
  ordinary users could be blocked from
  doing administrative operations by simply having them
  blocked from access to the administrative port.
  The client, however, had to be aware of
  the separation, and the <command>tarantool</command> command line
  client automatically selected the correct port
  with the help of a simple regular expression. SELECTs, UPDATEs,
  INSERTs, DELETEs and CALLs were sent to the primary port.
  Lua commands were sent to the administrative port.
