<title>Data and adminsitrative consoles</title>
<blockquote><para>
  This chapter provides a reference of Tarantool data operations
  and administrative commands.
</para></blockquote>
<para>
  Unlike many traditional data servers, Tarantool uses
  different TCP ports and client/server protocol for data
  operations and administrative operations.
  On start up, the server connects to three TCP ports:
  <simplelist>
    <member>
      read/write data port, to handle INSERTs, UPDATEs,
      DELETEs and SELECTs; the  default value of the port is
      <literal>33015</literal>,
    </member>
    <member>
      read only port, that only accepts SELECTs
      <literal>33015</literal>,
    </member>
  </simplelist>
  
  The data protocol is binary; a complete description is
  provided in doc/box-protocol.txt. 

  <simplelist>
    <member>
      administrative port, which defaults to 
      /write data port, to handle INSERTs, UPDATEs,
      DELETEs and SELECTs; the  default value of the port is
      <literal>33015</literal>,
    </member>
    <member>
      read only port, that only accepts SELECTs
      <literal>33015</literal>,
    </member>
  </simplelist>

</para>
<para></para>
  separation of ports is done in part to allow system
  administrators to secure the read/write port or the
  administrative port. The values of read-only, read-write and
  administrative ports can be specified in the configuration file.
</para>
<para>
  How command line client understands what port to use.
