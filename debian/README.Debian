Debian package provides some additional options in config-file:


* file_descriptors = INTVALUE

  Init script will do 'ulimit -f INTVALUE' command before starting tarantool.

* save_snapshots = COUNT
  
  Count of snapshots to save (default = 10). COUNT=0 disables removing
  old snapshots.


There are script tarantool_snapshot_rotate (1) that is started every day
using cron.daily.
